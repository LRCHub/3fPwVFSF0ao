Into the night moonless cold and black
Hell is waiting, there is no turning back
Suddenly the air was on fire
Your buddy never had a chance
His blood on your hands you'll never forget
His cold and lifeless glance
Times of war are times of death
And now the killing is on
Now the killing is on
Mortal fear is creeping in your mind
And soul tonight
Nowhere to hide
Eye to eye, facing the enemy
Brave at heart, fighting for liberty
Heroes or fools
Out in the fields bitterness rules
Eye to eye, facing a deadly threat
Don't look back, look straight ahead
With the will to survive
Just keep up the faith
And victory is on your side
You closed his eyes
Forever he'll rest
Another victim another life
The hawks are hunting and you are the pray
So keep yourself alive
Flames of fury like the purgatory
Burning high, burning the sky
Eye to eye, facing the enemy
Unlimited rage, rage
Is driving you mad
Unlimited fury, fury
Twisting in your head
Can't stand the pain, pain
It's driving you insane
You scream for vengeance, vengeance
But who's to blame
Aimless, like a drifter on the sea
Caught up in reality of war
Restless, always on the run
Hopes and dreams, they're gone
Take me away
Eye to eye, facing the enemy
Eye to eye, facing the enemy
Face to face, heroes or fools
Back to back, out in the fields
The bitterness rules
Eye to eye, look straight ahead
Face to face, the will to survive
Don't look back, just keep up the faith
And victory is on your side
On your side at last
