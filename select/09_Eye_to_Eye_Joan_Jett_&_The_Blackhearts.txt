I got a word or two cuz I don't understand
What's with me and you it's getting outta hand
Somethin's on your mind, you don't have to shout
Why can't we just talk and figure this thing out
I used to think that you and me would stay together
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
You make me come with you and then you give me grief
When I try to go you never let me leave
If I shut my mouth you think that I don't care
When I try to help you say it's your affair
It's not the way that you and me should treat each other
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
It's breakin' my heart we're grown' apart
An' we never seem to agree
I'm walkin' away we got nothin' to say
But that ain't the way it should be be
(We're history!)
It's such a drag we have this bad misunderstanding
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
