I got a word or two 'cuz I don't understand
What's with me and you, it's getting outta hand
Something's on your mind, you don't have to shout
Why can't we just talk and figure this thing out

I used to think that you and me would stay together
Why, oh why, can't we see eye to eye?
Why, oh why, can't we see eye to eye?

Well, you make me come with you and then you give me grief
When I try to go, you never let me leave
If I shut my mouth, you think that I don't care
When I try to help, you say it's your affair

It's not the way that you and me should treat each other
Why, oh why, can't we see eye to eye?
Why, oh why, can't we see eye to eye?

It's breakin' my heart, we're grown' apart
And we never seem to agree
Now I'm walkin' away, we got nothin' to say
But that ain't the way it should be be
Hey, we're history

It's such a drag we have this bad misunderstanding
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, can't we see eye to eye?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, can't we see eye to eye?

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
(Can't we see eye to eye?)
Why, oh why, oh why, oh, why?
(Can't we see eye to eye?)
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
(Can't we see eye to eye?)

Why, oh why, oh why?
Why, oh why, oh why?
