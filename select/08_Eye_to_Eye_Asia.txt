I don't want to see your picture
On a faded video
I don't want to turn the clock back
To the way it used to go

Can you give me any reasons
Why I made this sacrifice?
When you thought you walked on water
You were skating on thin ice

'Cause we don't see eye to eye
'Cause we don't see eye to eye

I don't want to be a memory
Just another Anglophile
I would never learn your language
Could it be there's no more time?

Is there any reason talking
'Bout your crazy point of view?
You can't even try to answer
The questions that I put to you
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
Cause we don't see eye to eye
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
